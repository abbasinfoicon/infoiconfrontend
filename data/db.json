But, React Native takes a different approach- it uses the native components found in iOS and Android. Which less the time, effort, and money by using just one coding language. Web developers can now write for mobile apps that seem to be truly native. The Java code can be shared with other platforms by rendering on React Native. One team can maintain two platforms and share a common technology- React. Know What React Native is and How it Work? React Native philosophy is to learn once, write anywhere! Earlier, features implemented in Swift for iOS app development had to be implemented separately in Java for Android. This leads to work duplication and asymmetrical apps. Gratefully, React Native has deftly resolved that problem. Giving utterance to React native, the purpose of developing this framework is to facilitate the creation of mobile apps. In simple words, you can code in JavaScrip and render in both Android and iOS apps platforms- it makes work and life easier. As React, React Native works on the coding uses of a mixture of JavaScript and XML (esque markup), popularly known as JSX. Which further involves native rendering APIs in Objective-C (particularly for iOS) or Jave (for Android). At run time, it uses native components on the cosponsoring platform like Android.view, Uiview, div. It's a better approach to building three apps for the price of one. "

In order to grow business in the international market, every business uses the internet to save costs, and web applications help to exchange information on the internet and aid to perform secure transactions on websites. The HTTP protocol can be used to access a web API via the internet. It's a framework for creating and developing RESTFUL HTTP services. Web APIs are built using technologies such as Java, ASP.NET, and others. A web server or a web browser can both use this framework. Essentially, it is a web development idea that is limited to the client-side of a Web Application and does not include information about a web server or web browser. Among other services, Web API services are preferable to use with an application that doesn't support SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) but requires web service. It is an ideal interface when creating resource-oriented services. Moreover, it is also the best framework for high-performance and fast services development. It is used to enhance the products by accessing another company's data, software services, or code, thereby providing additional features while saving time and money. Internal/Private APIs are created exclusively for inside company purposes. They are not listed in public API directories and are not known to the outside world, nor are they accessible to anyone or any system outside the company. They are administered in-house through an API developer site that uses authentication and authorization procedures to protect API access and use."

It is a free, open-source framework initially written in the ActionScript 3 programming language for use with Adobe Flex, Flash, and AIR. It has since been ported to practically all of the major web development platforms. Besides, it helps developers break down the coding concerns for an application into three different tiers, i.e., MVC. In the classic MVC meta-pattern implementation, the application tiers are delineated by 3 Singletons (each class can only create one instance). Model caches in the design are proxies that offer an API for modifying the data model (including data retrieved from remote services). View caches named references to Mediators, which adapt and manage the user interface's view components. Meanwhile, the Controller keeps named mappings to command classes, which are stateless and are created only when needed. The Façade, a fourth Singleton, streamlines development by offering a single interface for communications across the application. This class makes it possible for other Core actors to talk to each other in a loosely coupled way. Thus, it eliminates the need to import or work directly with the Core framework actors. Developers can use the Core actors as incidental to an interaction with the Façade when creating a concrete Façade implementation, and it minimizes the amount of API knowledge that a developer must have to use the framework successfully."
